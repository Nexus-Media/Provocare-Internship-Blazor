    TODO:
        Use the list 'productCategories' to display:
            Each product category
                Each product from the associated category using the component Card.razor -> Components/Card.razor
        
        Update the price for each Card when incremented. 
        Update the total price shown in the footer.

    
        Create a separate 'Counter' component that is used in 'Card' component. The components should be able to comunicate with each other and update accordingly.(Callbacks, EventHandlers)

        If the same product is present multiple times, instead of showing it that many times, show only 1 card with the unique animation from the video (0:06). Needs to work on desktop and tablets.

@*
    Add documentation and comments for your code. Try and explain the structure of the components and maybe decisions behind some design choises.



    You can create or add any file or folder that will be necessary for your implementation to work.
