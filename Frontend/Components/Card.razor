    TODO:
        Create a similar card to the one from the AnimatieCard.webm video.

        The card should:
            Be able to display:
                Name,
                Description,
                Price,
                (The above should be recieved as parameters),
                Counter, visible when incremented above 0.

        The card should change background color when 'selected', 'count' > 0.
        The counter is hidden while 'count' == 0.

        Card price needs to update according to the 'count'.

        Create the cart to be 'responsive'. The components should be able to adapt to different screen sizes.

        Add animations shown in the video.
